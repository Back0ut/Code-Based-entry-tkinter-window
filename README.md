Generating Random Code: The script generates a random code consisting of alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase) with dashes inserted every 3 characters.

Tkinter Window: It creates a Tkinter window titled "Rooms" where users can input a code.

Checking Code: When the user enters a code and presses Enter, the script checks if the entered code matches the generated code:

If the entered code matches the generated code, it displays "You entered!" in the Tkinter window.
If the entered code is "command=<'re'>", it regenerates a new random code and displays "Code regenerated. Enter the new code." in the Tkinter window.
If the entered code doesn't match the generated code and is not "command=<'re'>", it displays "Error! Not a valid code." in the Tkinter window.
Explanation of "command=<'re'>": This special command allows the user to regenerate a new random code. When the user enters this command, the script regenerates a new code and prompts the user to enter the new code. This feature is helpful if the user wants to reset or refresh the code without closing the application.

You can include this explanation in the README.md file of your GitHub repository to provide clarity to users about how the script works and how they can interact with it. Additionally, you can also add installation instructions and any other relevant information in the README file.
